	Hello, everyone! Another day, another utility! Today is sponsored by... myself!

	EaseUI is a utility that allows for both simple and advanced UI animations! Full customizability to you, the creator!

	If you need any assistance, feel free to join the Core Discord server (https://discord.gg/core-creators) and ping me (@Nicholas Foreman#0001)
	in #lua-help or #core-help! I will happily assist you. :)

	Usage:
		1) Do not put this script in the hierarchy; keep it in `Project Content` > `Scripts`
		2) Drag and drop this script into the custom properties of any script you want to use it with
		3) Inside the script that you are using EaseUI in, insert this line at the top:
			local EaseUI = require(script:GetCustomProperty("EaseUI"))
		4) Congratulations, you can proceed to use EaseUI!
